These days, crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter offer entrepreneurs and artists a novel and vital means of procuring finance for new innovative ideas [1]. Although many success stories exist, perfecting a proposal is not easy; 63% of all Kickstarter projects fail [2]. Reasons can manifest from the online nature of crowdfunding, whereby separation of entrepreneurs and investors means that information asymmetries occur [3]. Confronted with uncertainty, investors must evaluate a project based on only the information provided. Thus, nascent challenges in establishing credibility exist in abundance. Another potential reason for this lies in the initial financing stages; investors must rely on intangible cues, such as descriptions, to comprehend the product idea. Thus, entrepreneurial narratives have been proposed as a vital part of a crowdfunding proposal [1,[4], [5], [6]]. Entrepreneurial narratives deliver a personalized account of the projects' vision while articulating the investment prospects. It also provides insight into the person behind the project to potential investors. Accordingly, it reasons to say that the projects' narrative communicative style is as important as the idea itself in persuading investors of the entrepreneurs' credibility [6]. What entrepreneurs communicate  has been shown to play an essential role in crowdfunding proposals. Hence, the exploration of language is gaining increased interest in entrepreneurship literature [7,8].
[3f]
Much of the prior work concerning communication content has highlighted aspects that potential investors can use as signals of entrepreneurial credibility. For example, examinations on the quality of the information provided on a product [9], social networks of the entrepreneurs [[10], [11], [12]], and privacy cues [13]. More recently, the verbal content of project proposals has been studied to help understand communication content [1,4,11]. However, following an extensive review on communication content in crowdfunding literature , we found three omissions in the current literature: an understanding of the use of vague language in influencing crowdfunding success, a distinct analysis on both the description and the R&C section, and lastly, a method for optimizing the combination of features that will result in the highest probable causes of project success.

Our study addresses these with a novel method for extracting and analyzing vagueness1 within textual data obtained from Kickstarter. Vagueness is a language used in everyday discourse that signals that the communicator does not have the sufficient knowledge or understanding necessary for effective communication [14]. Prior literature on competitive dynamics has shown that vagueness can help to confuse rival firms [15] and prevent market entry [16]. Despite this, analysis of its individual effects, mainly when used within entrepreneurial narratives, is unexplored. For example, suppose vague stylistic language is present. In that case, it is reasonable to assume that entrepreneurs lack the required knowledge to portray a credible case that deserves rational attention from potential investors. Consequently, investors will avoid these entrepreneurial ideas due to issues of credibility.

Another issue of credibility arises due to the nature of online technology. Platforms do not facilitate direct face-to-face communication between two parties. When such a barrier exists, literature has shown that the two-sidedness proposition should be utilized. For example, Jensen et al. [17] showed increased credibility in anonymous product reviews when positive and negative aspects were presented. Consequently, we posit that crowdfunding investors will also utilize the two-sidedness of the entrepreneurs' argument to assist in their decision-making—more recent proposals on Kickstarter force users to consider the R&C of their projects. Doing so opens an avenue in which to assess the two-sidedness proposition within crowdfunding research directly. Although prior studies have explicitly stated the collection of R&C data [1,18], a discrete analytical investigation of each section was not made. This is problematic as prior research has shown that linguistic style [7], language preferences [8], and semantics [19,20] can all influence funding success and that differences in these variables should naturally exist upon further investigation. Such an analysis can provide unique implications on how investors interpret each side of the entrepreneurial narrative.

Lastly, this is the first paper to analyze communication content with a probabilistic Bayesian network-based decision support mechanism  to the best of our knowledge. Specifically, we use the significant variables found within multiple regression analyses to identify probabilistic causal features to help predict funding success. Usually, such a task requires expert knowledge to analyze causal relationships on the target variable. However, in the BNM method, we implemented an evolutionary search heuristic based on a Genetic algorithm  to machine-learn these probabilistic causal features. This approach allows for an near-optimal explanation based on a thorough and concise exploration of the features causing the most probable cause of funding success [21]. In this work, we focus on the communication content embedded within Kickstarter entrepreneurial narratives by implementing a persuasion model that focuses on the language expectancies of investors. We follow and expand upon prior work investigating linguistics and language preferences in entrepreneurial narratives [7,8] by exploring textual vagueness and the two-sidedness proposition. The theoretical approach, hypotheses, method, and results are explored in the following sections.

Crowdfunding is immensely popular today, allowing entrepreneurs to present innovative ideas to a broad audience of potential investors. In addition, this medium provides a novel avenue for entrepreneurs to take their ideas to the crowd directly [22], moving the source of finance from traditional means to everyday people [3]. Multiple reward avenues for investing within crowdfunding exist, including reward-, equity-, lending-, and donation-based [18]. This study investigates a reward-based platform: Kickstarter. Kickstarter allows a wide variety of projects, including arts and design, technology, and games. If an investor backs an entrepreneur in reward-based crowdfunding, they will receive a non-financial reward in exchange for the monetary contribution [18] if the project is successful [23]. To date, just under 200,000 projects have been funded successfully on Kickstarter, amounting to just under 19 million total backers and over 5 billion dollars of investment [24].

Online crowdfunding is a moderately recent yet growing phenomenon. While studies first focused on the overarching phenomenon and basic mechanisms [10,12], recent literature has investigated more nuanced features of the funding process. As a result, scholars now investigate questions surrounding investor experience and roles, information provision mechanisms, informational value [3,22,23], culture and geography [25], and privacy assurances [13]. More recently, researchers have explored the role of language [26], including entrepreneurial narratives. For instance, it has been shown that project success can be influenced by entrepreneurial narratives such as narcissism [4], positive tones [1,11], ongoing journey vs. results-in-progress [28], subjectivity vs. objectivity [6], as well as entrepreneurial vs. project idea narratives [5]. Other studies have also used lexicon-based dictionaries that explore constructs such as monetary evidence, female and social aspects, and affect-based tones [8,[28], [29], [30]].

In general, crowdfunding literature has drawn parallels with traditional investment processes using extant theories such as signaling theory [1,3,6,30] and market mechanism [22]. However, crowdfunding investors are typically laypersons without formal investment training. Furthermore, their investments amount to small financial capital compared to traditional sources. The nature of crowdfunding suggests that backers of crowdfunding projects are not investing in means that make sense within more traditional investment literature. Given this, the use of traditional entrepreneurial and investment theories may not provide the fundamental principles needed to understand crowdfunding, requiring the search for an alternative theoretical lens.

In this study, LET is utilized to provide the foundational inquiry surrounding language used in entrepreneurial narratives seen in crowdfunding campaigns [31]. LET is premised on the assumption that individuals have certain expectations formed by observing specific language behavior that is rule-based. Such expectations are grounded in interpersonal, social, and cultural norms [7,32], leading to expectations developing based on appropriate communication styles [31,32]. Upon viewing language, ones' experiences and expectations can affect the individuals' acceptance or rejection of a persuasive message [33,34]. However, LET also postulates that expectations are not unique to any individual but rather to specific communicators that can aggregate into groups, i.e., online shoppers [17] or investors [7].

LET views some groups as privileged to use specific language and remain more persuasive over other groups based on group identities. For instance, privileged groups may use more aggressive language that ranges in low to high intensity and remain persuasive, whereas the same cannot be said for nonprivileged groups [31,32,34]. This range in ones' ability to persuade based on techniques fitting to their group identity is known as a senders' bandwidth [17,35]. When persuasive language is used outside of this bandwidth, an expectancy violation is committed and can manifest in two forms: negative and positive violations [33,34]. Negative violation of expectations reduces the credibility of the communication sender resulting in less persuasion and attitude change. Conversely, positive violations garner credibility, foster persuasion, and increase the likelihood of the communication receiver adopting the advocated attitude [32].

LET within crowdfunding provides a unique yet distant application of the theory from its traditional beginnings. Online crowdfunding constrains users to know little about each persons' characteristics, and there is no guarantee of the entrepreneurs' true intentions. The only known facts are that entrepreneurs were sufficiently motivated to propose an idea looking for financial support. Importantly, as no knowledge on which group identity an entrepreneur belongs to is known on crowdfunding, operationalizing sender bandwidth on known group identity is not feasible.

In the absence of knowing, high and low intensity and aggressive or non-aggressive language traits cannot readily explain expectancy violations of entrepreneurial narratives. At this point, expectancy can only arise from the accepted norms in the language itself. Jensen et al. [17] validated this notion, showing that anonymous product reviews' two-sidedness and affect intensity provided language expectancy violations. Like Jensen et al. [17], we assume a narrow bandwidth will be afforded for persuasion resulting in a higher chance of language expectancy violations that affect credibility. Prior crowdfunding literature has proposed that linguistics used by social and commercial entrepreneurs [7] and the language preferences of investors [8] can violate expectations. Furthermore, [7,8] show that the language properties of an entrepreneurs' narrative can play a significant role in influencing investors' judgment of credibility. Based on LET, we explore four communication content features that we propose influence investors' expectations: vague communication, linguistic features, affect intensity, and two-sided persuasion.

3.2. Vague communication
Based on the Theory of Vagueness, vagueness appears when “borderline cases” of language is used, making such language “doubtful” or “ill-defined.” Consequently, the use of such language makes it impossible to assert or deny its application [36]. Hiller further defines vagueness as a psychological construct representing the ‘state of mind’ of a communicator who does not sufficiently command the facts, knowledge, or understanding required for maximally effective communication [14]. The pioneering work of vagueness originates in the education field, where Miller and his colleagues' observations in lecturing led to the development of the vagueness dictionary [14]. However, the theory of vagueness has its roots in semantics and epistemology [37]. Therefore, the study of vagueness within crowdfunding communication content is of value too. Although the evolutionary reasons for using vague language are unclear [36], vague language is still persistent and plentiful in everyday discourse, providing valid grounds for further scholarly inquiry enveloping entrepreneurial narratives. In essence, too much vagueness in a crowdfunding proposal may confuse the projects' vision. In addition, the presence of vague language could signal to the investor that the entrepreneur lacks the required knowledge needed for a successful implementation of the idea. This is problematic given that credibility suggests the source is knowledgeable [30], and thus, vague language may have a critical influence on the likelihood of obtaining investment.

Examples of vagueness include qualifiers before numbers, non-numerical terms to refer to indefinite amounts, and approximation. It also encompasses language such as bluffing that shifts comprehensions' responsibility onto the reader. Vague language exerts more demands on the receiver of such communication to translate the given information, even in noncomplex language [15,16]. In this study, we interpret vagueness as a contributor to information quality. We posit that the vaguer the language presented, the greater the likelihood that the quality of the information presented will decrease. As an investor, this will make reading the entrepreneurial narrative a more cognitive task, and thus, grasping the context needed to make an informed decision will decrease. An investor will have a negative language expectancy violation resulting in reduced attitudinal change and no investment. Thus,
H1

: High use of vague language in entrepreneurial narratives will reduce the likelihood of investment in online crowdfunding.


3.3. Linguistic features
Linguistic features used within communication content can play an essential role in entrepreneurial narratives. Linguistic features are a direct way for potential investors to get close to the entrepreneur while remaining anonymous. As they are not dependent on the entrepreneurs' expectations on what the investors may or may not expect, entrepreneurs have flexibility in their linguistic style by carefully planning and rehearsing their proposal [7]. Effective use of linguistic features can signal entrepreneurs' care in formulating their ideas to help reassure investors that they are capable and driven to deliver on their promise [38]. Furthermore, the correct use of linguistics can help build a relationship with an audience and keep investors engaged in the content [7,8,38]. The effective use of linguistics has been seen in P2P lending, where appropriate linguistics led to enhanced persuasion and increased lending behavior [39]. In addition, research on fraud detection showed that non-fraudulent financial disclosures had higher lexical word diversity, suggesting that particular linguistics can be more credible [40]. Following prior crowdfunding research [7] we also adopt the notion that linguistic styles used by entrepreneurs on crowdfunding platforms will impact an investment decision. Therefore, through the lens of LET, we examine three linguistic features: descriptive language, paragraph structure, and reading ease.

Within crowdfunding entrepreneurial narratives, entrepreneurs are tasked with explaining their product. It has been shown that the greater use of descriptive language can contribute to the reader's ability to obtain integrated information as a more detailed description of an object can be made [41]. For example, research within online shopping has shown that when reviews display more detailed information about products, consumers deem this more informative and of greater quality [42]. The same notion can be applied to crowdfunding. Any entrepreneurs who do an exhausting job detailing their product to potential investors will make more informed decisions based on integrated information. It reasons to say, compared with entrepreneurs that do not use much descriptive language, ones that do will be favored by informed investors creating a positive expectancy violation based on greater information quality. The result of this positive language expectancy violation will be increased attitudinal change by the investor. Therefore, we hypothesize:
H2a

: High use of descriptive language in entrepreneurial narratives will increase the likelihood of investment in online crowdfunding.


Paragraph structure is determined by how much information an entrepreneur provides in their communication content. This information is an essential tool for the entrepreneur as nearly all projects on crowdfunding are at the beginning stages of their life cycle and thus are usually unproven and intangible to the potential investors. Thus, the information provided on the crowdfunding page is the primary source of factual information an investor can use. Providing information that potential investors can evaluate the project with will be vital for credibility [43]. If more information is provided, then it is expected that potential investors will positively react to more factual information within the communication content. We posit that this will lead to a positive language expectancy violation and increase the persuasiveness of the narrative. The result will be increased project funding, and therefore, we hypothesize:
H2b

: Longer paragraph structure in entrepreneurial narratives will increase the likelihood of investment in online crowdfunding.


In communication research, it is well known that simple language than complex language can be more effective for persuasiveness. It has been shown that comprehension of language that matches that of the reader's ability plays a crucial role in engaging the reader [33] and can provide greater credibility even in circumstances of anonymity [17]. Research has shown that language complexity is an important feature in communication interpretability and persuasiveness [44]. In crowdfunding, entrepreneurs are unaware of who the potential investors are. Nonetheless, they should assume that they have a good grasp of linguistic complexity based on formal education. If an entrepreneur were to present their project with poor readability, it would be hard to follow, disengaging a potential investor. For instance, if a potential investor has high cognitive complexity and sees poor use of language within communication content, it will likely result in a negative language expectancy violation. As linguistics and linguistic complexity have evolved through social norms, we postulate that any departure from these, especially to a more linguistically complex investor, will result in a negative language expectancy violation, reducing the persuasiveness of the entrepreneurs' arguement [33]. This will reduce the entrepreneur's investment opportunity and hence:
H2c

: Low reading ease in entrepreneurial narratives will reduce the likelihood of investment in online crowdfunding.


3.4. Affect intensity
Affect intensity can be defined as the number of emotion-laden words used within the text. Affect is defined within a spectrum that ranges from very negative to very positive sentiment. Previous crowdfunding research has shown that affect intensity within the descriptions of entrepreneurial narratives can have mixed effects. For example, Zhou et al. [43] found that positive affect intensity had a more significant impact, whereas Jiang et al. [45] found that positive and negative affect significantly influenced crowdfunding success. In this study, the role of affect cannot be overestimated. The direct use or absence of affect is not the direct cause of persuasion, and in isolation, will not promote entrepreneurial credibility. Instead, it combines the preordained expectations determined by the online setting and context and how these are violated using affect within entrepreneurial narratives [17]. Accordingly, it is conceptually reasonable to assume that the description and R&C section will have varied expectations of sentimental language. This is because the description section is used for shining light on the entrepreneurial idea to gain interest and positive reactions from investors. In contrast, the R&C section is designed for entrepreneurs to display potential adverse outcomes. Investigation into fraudulent documents has shown that when more positive sentiment is used within serious documents, it is usually because the communicator wants to hide any negative aspects [40]. Within the crowdfunding R&C section, entrepreneurs are asked to provide serious deliberation on potential negative aspects of the project and how they can deal with them if they arise. Therefore, we suggest that the description section will allow for a narrow bandwidth for positive affect. Thus, a positive language expectancy violation will occur if this is present within the communication content. For the R&C section, we suggest no such luxury will be afforded. If the R&C section is too positively toned, investors will have a negative language expectancy violation as the argument will be less credible leading to no investment. We therefore hypothesize:
H3a

: Positive affect intensity in the project description will increase the likelihood of investment in online crowdfunding.

H3b

: Positive affect intensity in the risk and challenges will lead to a decreased likelihood of investment in online crowdfunding.


3.5. Two-sided persuasion
The introduction of the R&C section within the Kickstarter platform was a direct attempt to nudge entrepreneurs into thinking about, deliberating on, and finally presenting any potential issues that could arise in a project. Within Kickstarter, the description is the positive aspects of the entrepreneurial idea, whereas the R&C is the potential negative aspects. Together they form a two-sided persuasive argument for investors. Research on product reviews in IS [17] and marketing [46] has shown that two-sided messages represent a central form of persuasive communication. When viewers of communication do not know the communicators' reputation or other credibility signals , relying on two-sided arguments can help designate the communicator as credible [17].

Prior crowdfunding research has explored the role of semantical topics. For instance, Jiang et al. [45] explored narratives from the Chinese platform dreamore and found greater funding success when entrepreneurs talked about dreams and creative aspects of the idea. Lee and Sohn [20] also explored semantic topics seen in crowdfunded software projects on Kickstarter. This study provided good information to aspiring software entrepreneurs on which topics to explore in the description section. Despite this, no crowdfunding research has shed light on the effect of specific semantic topics in the R&C section. This study attempts to identify the semantic topics that create a successful two-sided argument within entrepreneurial narratives. We postulate that compared to a one-sided entrepreneurial narrative; the use of compelling semantic topics that present a two-sided argument will be positively evaluated by potential investors. Thus, those entrepreneurs who move away from a one-sided message may increase the likelihood of a positive violation of a potential investor's expectations. This language expectancy violation would then increase credibility attributed to the entrepreneur's arguement, and thus we hypothesize:
H4

: Semantic topics that display effective two-sidedness in the risks and challenges section will increase the likelihood of investment.


This paper used a text analytical framework to understand the effects of communication content within entrepreneurial narratives on crowdfunding success. Specifically, data was crawled from Kickstarter between 2015 and 2020 and then cleaned into an experimental dataset. Next, vagueness, linguistic, affect intensity, and semantic topics were all extracted from the text. Next, the projects' success or failure was analyzed using logistic regression, while ordinary least squares regression was employed for examining the continuous variable of funding percent. Lastly, a Bayesian network analysis was employed for understanding causal knowledge of funding percent.

First, we collected Kickstarter URLs from webrobots.com.2 We removed duplicates from this list, as well as variables that provided no information. Further, only projects with either a success or failure status were retained. For the textual data, the following preprocessing steps were necessary: Projects that had no textual data were removed; projects with less than five words in both the description and R&C section were dropped from the analysis; and non-English projects were identified and dropped using langdetect.3 The final dataset included 28,103 projects, 17,598 failed, and 10,496 successful.


We employed Hiller's communication vagueness dictionary [14] to extract vague communication from the text. This included the extended vague categories proposed in [47]. The final lexicon consisted of 377 words that help form vague communication within the English language. Two further categories were used for detecting vagueness, namely contranyms and polysemy. Contranyms are words that have two contradictory meanings and produced a lexicon consisting of 176 words [47]. Polysemy is a form of lexical ambiguity that leads to vagueness. These word forms have distinct meanings and cannot be used in the same sentence [48]. Finally, we included words that have twelve or more meanings providing a 517-word lexicon.

Scores based on these lexicons were extracted with our proposed adaption of the TF-IDF algorithm. First, Eq. shows the term frequency TF of a vague word t in the vagueness lexicon V, and the number of vague words t within each document t ? d was calculated given the length of each document. Next, the total occurrence of t within the corpus was calculated in Eq. before the inverse document frequency was calculated in Eq.. Lastly, the scores were calculated using Eq.. Based on this measurement, we operationalized the vagueness scores as the percentage of vagueness within one given document. We took a ratio of how prominent this was compared to the number consistent in the whole corpus. Thus, vagueness is operationalized as the amount of vague language used within communicative content compared to other entrepreneurs.

Descriptive language is the amount of descriptive content provided to the potential investor. It is measured by counting the number of notional words, including verbs, adverbs, and nouns contained within a crowdfunding page. Following previous work [41], we also implemented parts-of-speech  tagging to extract and count the number of notional words. As this approach identifies the number of unique words that fit within these categories, the more descriptive language can be operationalized as an entrepreneurial narrative with a more significant number of these words.

Paragraph structure is the measure of how many sentences occur in each passage of text. This was operationalized by counting one sentence every time a full stop appeared. Thus, a higher number for paragraph structure represents that the passage of text has more information quantity for investors to process on an entrepreneurial narrative. Paragraph structure, however, does not provide information on the amount of information within a given sentence. As a result, we needed to employ further measures to rectify this issue.

Reading ease attempts to understand the complexity of a documents' vocabulary and its syntax within a sentence. If a given text has poor readability, this could increase the cognitive capacity needed to understand the information presented. We determine how readable a given crowdfunding project is by employing the Flesch reading-ease test to the entrepreneurial narratives. This score can be operationalized whereby a higher score indicates textual information that is generally easier to read. Thus, entrepreneurial narratives that demonstrate a higher score will help remove any unnecessary cognitive requirements for understanding the communication content of an entrepreneur on crowdfunding.

Affect intensity was calculated by using the popular tool known as VADER.4 As stated by the authors, VADER leverages the advantages of parsimonious rule-based modeling and is readily generalized to multiple domains. Further, it requires no training data [49] and provides affect intensity on a scale from ?0.99 to 0.99, allowing enough variance in text for analysis to be used without moderation to the scores.

Following [50], we implemented the popular Latent Dirichlet Allocation  model [51]. Before using LDA, the text was analyzed using the coherence value to discover the degree of semantic similarity between words with high scores within models containing topics ranging from 2 to 400 [52]. Then, using the optimized number of topics for this dataset, we applied the LDA model [51]. The probability that a document includes a given topic is given as the vector's weight based on the extracted topic's words and their associated weights within a given topic. After running the coherence value, we obtained an optimum of 16 topics. We then ran the LDA model using 16 topics as N and obtained the dominance percentage of each topic relative to each document. Next, we manually summarized topics obtained based on their clarity to the task  and used the dominance percentage to measure its influence in each document. This provided three data points, one for each topic in the dataset. Lastly, each topic obtained was then labeled to represent a semantic topic in each project R&C: “External needs,” “design and development,” and “production delays.”

Following prior work that used entrepreneurial narratives as their primary data  and other prominent crowdfunding research , we controlled for the two factors that are used to provide direct information about the idea itself: images and videos. Therefore, image present and video present were created as dummy variables whereby present was set to one, and anything else was set to zero. Our rationale is that images and videos are the two other primary sources of information that an investor can use to gain essential information on the entrepreneurial idea itself and were deemed necessary within our regression models.


The use of BNM has the following advantage over the regression analyses in providing a more rigorous analysis based on causal knowledge underlying the target node. Implementing BNM moves the analysis away from the rigid nature of regression models to one whereby causal knowledge can be found in a nonlinear fashion. Specifically, Bayesian networks allow data to be probabilistically altered, so that hypothesis testing on the target node is possible. A near-optimal configuration can be found through multiple trials that will probabilistically suggest how much the communication content needs to be adjusted before achieving the highest likelihood of funding success. This can be viewed as the amount needed to create a positive language expectancy violation. As a result, they are more persuaded by the entrepreneurs' credibility and invest in the project. The use of Bayesian networks has been effectively demonstrated in complex business decision-making [54], healthcare issues [55], and public health [56].

The first step of the BNM is to extract the significant data points from the regression analysis. Next, discretization of the continuous data is necessary. The BNM used an intuitive approach based on a genetic algorithm  to find various discretization bins. The GA attempted to maximize the R2 between the discretized and its corresponding continuous variables. Thus, besides the two binary variables , all continuous independent variables used were discretized into four distinct bins to represent the node of that feature within the network. Next, we computed a given node's conditional probability based upon values assigned to other nodes within the data space: a directed acyclic graph is created. In this, nodes represent domain variables, and arcs between nodes represent probabilistic dependencies [57]. Given the probability that B is not equal to zero in the Bayes theorem, the conditional and marginal probabilities of A and B's are first calculated. Next, the network's joint probability distribution is calculated to produce evidence of probable outcomes before the chain rule is applied to the joint probabilities of the network created. Following [58], we used the Kullback-Leibler  Divergence metric to learn the network. The KL Divergence allows two probability distributions to be compared [58]. If we represent two probability distributions as A and B, it is possible to calculate the strength of the direct relationship between two of the nodes.

In our study, we chose the Sons and Spouses  network architecture. Based on the tree-augmented Na?ve Bayes architecture, the SS model allows spouses of son nodes to be considered for analysis [55]. A GA was used to automatically hypothesize outcomes through the learned SS network until a near-optimal network was found. In a Bayesian network, GAs work in the following way: A population is chosen, and all data points' quality is examined. Then, children are produced from selected parents. These children have a probability near zero so that they can “mutate.” After a selection criterion, individuals are removed from the population, also known as an iteration or generation [55,59]. In a Bayesian network, children are selected based on two operators: Crossover and mutation. Mutation is responsible for exploring and avoiding local optima, while crossover attempts to increase the population's quality. Next, a reduction helps identify an optimum solution in a small number of iterations.

To identify the GA's best solution within the Bayesian network, we used the generalized Bayes factor. This measurement serves as a criterion to assess a solution's strength compared to other solutions found. Thus, the GBF of a given explanation x of all possible explanations given the evidence e [21] allows two competing solutions to be tested. However, as Bayesian networks are based on more than one piece of evidence, the chain rule also has to be applied to the GBF, in which a new explanation of y must be considered and then updated for analysis with the chain rule, in which e1 indicates that the evidence is valid based on multiple pieces of evidence [21].


A summary of the descriptive statistics is presented in Table 3. Approximately 37% of the projects were successful and accounted for just over ten thousand projects. Further, the percent of funding averaged 167% , just under double the funding amount requested. Further analysis showed that successful projects also varied greatly in their success, with a 5048% variance in funding percent found. In this research, we employed two models for regression analyses. Model 1.1 included vagueness and linguistic features and was applied to both the description and R&C sections. Model 1.2 added semantic features and was analyzed on the R&C section. Model 1.1 was the primary analysis used to compare both the description and the R&C. Model 1.2 offers a test of appropriate semantic topics within the two-sidedness proposition.

This paper builds on communication content literature by exploring entrepreneurial narratives within crowdfunding. Our study attempted to answer some open questions that still surround the use of language embedded within entrepreneurial narratives. Based on the language expectancy theory , this paper argues that the language used within entrepreneurial narratives can contribute to an entrepreneur's perception of credibility, resulting in showing varied amounts of persuasiveness towards an investor. Within each entrepreneurial narrative context ), our study showed that certain expectations from investors in terms of the communication content used by entrepreneurs was significantly influential upon the investor's investment decision.

Among various interesting findings, this papers' first main finding suggested that using vague language in the entrepreneurial narratives was associated with negative project success. Firstly, as proposed in vagueness theory [14,60], when a communicator uses too much vague language, it is indicative of a communicator who does not sufficiently command the facts, knowledge, or understanding required for effective communication. We found that entrepreneurs with higher levels of vague language in their communication had a significantly less likelihood of receiving funding. Following the LET principles, we believe this is because potential investors see vague language as less persuasive due to a lack of clarity and presentation of poor-quality information. At this point, we postulate that investors have a negative language expectancy violation and choose not to invest. Next, evidence of the role that linguistic features can have on investment likelihood. In line with prior crowdfunding research [7], our results suggest that linguistic features can positively and negatively violate investors' expectations. As we posited, we believe this influences investors' credibility assessment of an entrepreneur resulting in less investment.

Affect intensity was found to influence entrepreneurial narratives in two distinct ways. Positive affect increased funding success in project descriptions, whereas the opposite effect was found for the R&C section. This finding conceptually makes sense when we consider each section's role in influencing the tone of the entrepreneurial narrative. Thus, expectations of this section were found to contribute differently to project success. Lastly, following the two-sidedness propositions, semantic topics were extracted from the R&C section. Prior work has explored the positive semantic topics within project descriptions ; however, as we propose, credible arguments stem from including some negatives in entrepreneurial narratives. Our findings suggest that entrepreneurial narratives that explore the potential issue of design and development alongside production delays can provide effective two-sidedness. In turn, this leads to a positive language expectancy violation resulting in increased investment.


This research builds on prior crowdfunding literature that views entrepreneurial narratives and communication content as a leading reason for the success or failure of a project [1,4,[6], [7], [8],11,27,28,30,45]. Additionally, this work has followed on from work employing LET. For instance, Parhankangas and Renko [7] found that the linguistic style used among commercial and social entrepreneurs violated investors' language expectancies in various ways. Du et al. [8] used a machine learning approach to assess linguistic features that caused funding success. In contrast, we suggest that language vagueness and two-sidedness are also factors that contribute to crowdfunding success. Also, unlike previous work, we further tested known attributes, such as linguistic features and affect, using separate data points that represented the two distinct sections now found in Kickstarter entrepreneurial narratives.

We contribute to the existing literature on LET. Previous LET studies have highlighted message features, such as language preference, intensity, and linguistic features [7,8,17]. We suggest that language expectations can also be influenced using vague language. Our results draw attention to the negative role vague language can have in language that is supposed to come from a more knowledgeable communicator than the receiver on the given topic. As information asymmetry is a complex problem for many online platforms, we show that vague language will likely negatively violate language expectations of the communication receivers.

Next, we have pioneered an analysis to understand the specific communication content needed on both sides of the argument to maximize funding success likelihood. By identifying the semantic topics within the Kickstarter R&C section, we have built on prior LET research using the two-sidedness proposition [17] and extended its use to crowdfunding research. Our findings indicate that two-sidedness is also an effective tool for crowdfunding entrepreneurs that may help persuade investors to invest in the entrepreneur. Furthermore, such findings inform other platforms that they should actively encourage their users to be more balanced in their argumentation.

Prior research using LET has shown that when group identity is unknown [17], language expectancies, by proxy, can only stem from the language itself. Therefore, cultural norms and expectations are placed on the accepted norms within written language. For this reason, we included the tests of linguistic features and affect. Compared with prior crowdfunding literature, we have shown that these two variables are still predictors of crowdfunding success, however, dependent on the entrepreneurial section. Evidence of this was found whereby language affect was found to have a positive relationship within the description, yet a negative relationship within the R&C section. Theoretically, this suggests that the context of entrepreneurial narrative can play an influencing role in the types of expectations investors have when reading a crowdfunding pitch online.

From a practical perspective, our results have provided evidence of the importance of particular language used by entrepreneurs and how this has positive and negative consequences on the likelihood of receiving investment. Moreover, we have shown that even if an entrepreneur has a good idea, the way they present the idea through the careful choice of specific language may also be important in determining investment. Evidence of this was found in two regression analyses and also in a Bayesian network-based analysis. As Bayesian networks provide causal knowledge of the underlying target class, the use of this tool can guide entrepreneurs in effectively presenting their ideas to enhance the likelihood of investment. We identified a near-optimal solution of funding success using a genetic algorithm within a learned Bayesian network model. We imagine that using this Bayesian network and genetic algorithm methodology can also optimize effective feedback as an entrepreneur is preparing a page. Much like grammar and spelling checks embedded in a word processor, a similar tool can be built as a decision support mechanism to aid entrepreneurs.

Despite this study's merits, clear limitations exist. First, although our analysis relates to crowdfunding and entrepreneurial literature, our data limits the generalizability to just the Kickstarter platform. Second, although Kickstarter is a leader in crowdfunding, future work will have to strive to test our findings on other platforms. This leads to a further limitation. Finally, at present, Kickstarter is the only platform to include the R&C section specifically. Thus, creative ways to test the two-sided persuasion proposition on other platforms will be needed.

Next, the method for extracting the vague scores can only be used with English texts. Accordingly, its use and results may be suitable only for English-based platforms, meaning these scores' findings may only generalize to cultures that use English for their entrepreneurial narratives. Future work could adapt the framework to include other Latin-based languages. However, languages that fall outside of this may be harder to adopt. Further, we did not test for cause-and-effect relations in the Bayesian networks. Thus, the results obtained remain probabilistic and, therefore, should be interpreted and applied with care. Finally, any of the recommendations should be recognized as likelihoods rather than facts. Future research could examine cause-and-effect relations by building and analyzing such networks manually and testing relationships one-by-one.

Information research support systems operate with various kinds of information. These can be publications, electronic documents, electronic collections, ontological descriptions, data arrays, logical descriptions, etc. These resources, demanded by different groups of researchers, may be inaccessible due to the problems with their search and identification. Semantic links between information resources increase their value and provide additional opportunities for information search and identification.

According to the calculations of American experts, from 10% to 20% of scientific research could not be carried out if the information on the studied problem had been selected correctly. Therefore, it is quite natural that most scientists spend about 1/3 of their working time on scientific information collection and processing. And this indicator has the tendency to increase. The work on the harmonization of data and systematization of information resources is relevant to many professional fields [1].

The data integrated into the open semantic space is a body of knowledge about a certain subject area. At that, the use of resources is accompanied by the problems of rule determination for up-to-date resource copy obtaining and their conversion according to the specifics of the specific research environment. These problems are conditioned by the lack of adequate mechanisms to allow the distribution of high-demand science-intensive resources, as well as the heterogeneity of ways for resource representation and storage in the form of files, spreadsheets, databases, electronic documents, catalogs, etc. Most often, the indicated problems are resolved in each individual case individually.

In such a situation, the development of distributed information system , unifying the process of research result sharing, will contribute to the effective interaction of geographically and organizationally distributed groups of researchers, which emphasizes the relevance of this work as a whole.

The creation of technology for DIS prototype development to support research with the integration of data into an open semantic space is achieved by the following task solution:

the development of conceptual models for information resource storage system;

the study of the principles and the creation of automation algorithms for the scientific information process, including data binding and identification algorithms, namely: the description of links between the entities of the information system ;

the development of technology for metadata extraction from documents in the process of RIS integration using the ontological subject area model.

The information model of the developed DIS should be multi-layered and consist of the following components: data storage , metadata server, application  server, the support system for controlled classifier dictionaries designed to classify resources. According to the metadata server information, dynamic generation of system database diagrams and database maintenance are carried out, which store data that supports standard system functions, dynamically defined relations between documents, and dynamic allocation of system resources. The application server is responsible for user service and algorithm operation support, for example, morphological analysis or clustering and classification procedures. The resource management system requires the creation of a single reference system on the configuration and the content of the actual DIS. The presence of such a reference system is a prerequisite for the successful construction of a system managing distributed information resources.

In the information system aimed at scientific and educational activity support, it is important to keep the description of the entire life cycle of information resources and to be able to restore the resource state at any time. There are information resources that should be available for a long time. These include, for example, the documents and publications that make up the scientific heritage, the documents that have a long legal force, patents, multimedia information about historical events, which can be requested after any period of time. Besides, scientific reports from institutes, scientist speeches, letters, and memos can also have enormous historical significance, becoming more valuable over time. Therefore, IS should support the possibility of long-term and reliable storage of information resources with the possibility of their recovery.

In accordance with the reference model each resource  [2]:

has an identifier;

organized in accordance with the description of the resource. A resource can be complex and structured because it can consist of smaller resources and have links to other resources. From an organizational point of view, resources can be grouped into sets of resources, which are considered as a single entity;

can be regulated by the functions that control its life cycle, characterized by a set of inherent attributes and the methods that characterize its properties and relationships with other resources;

is expressed through the information object;

must be described by metadata, and may also be described or supplemented with additional metadata and abstracts.

Show All

In the information system, each Information resource corresponds to an Information object, which is a traditional secondary information object containing the description of a primary resource, i.e. an information object is an object that stores information about IS objects.

Since the information object is a resource, it inherits all of the abovementioned properties of the resource, i.e. has an identifier.

Information object is the most common concept in the system, representing an arbitrary unit of information in the information system.

Information objects can also be complex objects and can be grouped into the collections of information objects. Collections, in its turn, are also information objects, they inherit all aspects of information object modeling and their means of maintenance, for example, they can be annotated.

Information objects describe the main entities of the scientific information space such as publication, document, person, dictionary entry, function, and user, as well as the connections between them.

During the creation of an Intelligent information system , the following understanding of the fact is reasonable: the set of relationships between entities contained in the text and document metadata is described by the ontology of the information system [3]. This, in particular, implies the following important remark: it is the ontology of IIS that determines what will be considered a fact within the framework of this system, since it defines the relationships between the entities of the information system.

Collection is the main "object" with which the information system operates - it is a complete information object representing a structured description of a real entity , the totality of which constitute the system content.

Affiliation of the Document to the Class determines the semantic structure of the document, the attributes and the functions, as well as the methods of access to it. Functionality is set in the class: the set of Documents belonging to the same Class performs the same functions.

The document has a certain standard set of attributes, described by metadata, and functions, depending on the class and the type of document, and allows unique identification.

We will distinguish the following classes of documents: competences, training courses, organizations, data storage facilities, conferences, persons, publications, research projects, grants. Each document class can have many types and subtypes. For example, the "publication" document class may have the following types: monograph, article, preprint, etc.

An important step in the practical implementation of the approaches proposed in this paper should be the implementation of text analysis automation algorithms to extract facts.

The proposed research is focused on information system model development that unifies the process of research result - knowledge-intensive resource sharing. The result of the research will be the creation of a distributed IIS prototype supporting scientific activities, taking into account data binding, unifying the process of research result sharing.

The RIS model operates with the following entities: competences, training courses, organizations, data storage facilities, conferences, persons, publications, research projects, grants. Currently the main entities are Documents and Data.

The model should provide the following functionality:

Resource publishing, including registration, naming, annotation, and formatting procedures.

Analytical processing of resources

Access to published resources, including dynamic generation functions.

They need the function of resource monitoring and their meta description update for automated operation, the function of user notification about new resources and existing one update, and the dispatching function.

Today, the technological basis for RIS development is the technology based on three technological principles: these are WWW technologies, the LDAP directory model and Z39.50 protocol model. These technological components implement the basic functions of a distributed information system. Let's note that the standard Z39.50 contains almost all necessary components for this. No other standard  contains the full set of necessary rules governing the network access to databases and the abstraction from specific schemes and data structures, both for information search and its retrieval from storage and user provision with the necessary formats. The technologies based on the LDAP model are most suitable to implement management functions. Today LDAP based method is the easiest way to organize the technology of a "single access point" to information resources, including identification, authentication and authorization of users in distributed information system. An important circumstance is the fact that LDAP is based on the ideology of distributed information storage  against the background of global identification of all directory elements, contains the definitions of data replication mechanisms and procedures within itself between different servers and is very well supported by the developers of application and system software. The latter allows you to move simply from local to distributed management of information systems and control access to their resources [4].

The standard approach to the systematization of information is the classification of documents using taxonomies [5]. Taxonomy is a subject classification, which groups terms in the form of a managed dictionary  and organizes them into hierarchical structures. The most important task is the task of resource systematization , the solution of which requires to define the composition of logical semantic categories  and key terms  clearly covering a selected rather narrow subject area of interest to the user.

The basis of ontology is the creation of managed dictionaries  [6], taking into account the completeness of the information presented, that is, ontology is considered as a common part of the subject area model and thesaurus, connecting knowledge of the world with the knowledge of language, and a full-fledged thesaurus is impossible without ontology, since the simplest form is the skeleton of any data and/or knowledge system. Thesaurus can be interpreted as a stock of semantic information contained in the documents on this topic, that is, as the description of knowledge structure.

The Institute of Computational Technologies of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences has developed linguistic support for IS in scientific and educational activities, in particular, a multilingual computer science thesaurus in accordance with Z39.50 protocol and the modified ZThes data scheme.

The developed thesaurus implementation components allow you to view, edit and add thesaurus terms to the system through web forms as well as import and export terms as XML, RDF, DTD files with possible conversion of records into SKOS, MARC, MODS data schemas [7].

We considered the problem of data classification in a selected, rather narrow subject area related to information technology.

It is important to note that when you create scientific and educational information systems for which the bibliographic features of documents are much less important than usual, the subsets of the values of bibliographic metadata that make up the values of the facets are wider, as a rule. Thus, the references to various reprints  of the same document should be considered equivalent from the point of view of scientific and educational systems.

The key terms characterizing documents can also be matched by weights reflecting their importance for the classification of texts on a given topic. For example, the importance of the word "computer science" in the subject area on IT technologies, as it will be found in almost all documents on this topic. To determine the weights of key terms, you can use, for example, TF-IDF measure, which evaluates the importance of a term in the context of this topic.

The choice of key terms with orientation only to the document text may not be the best solution if the terms characterizing the document have many synonyms or various associative links. Scientific terms may be in complex relationships with each other, express narrower or broader concepts, may be related by similarity, by contrast, or by other associations. To be able to take this into account, it is necessary to compile special conceptual reference books  for each language.

The method of coordinate indexing provides greater flexibility as compared to classification indexing, in particular, it allows you to get rid of the fixed lists of subject headings and form them automatically. The main advantage of the coordinate indexing method is a multidimensional reflection of the text content, which allows you to find information on any combination of features not previously foreseen. For this reason, in this paper we will consider this type of indexing.

Let's describe the algorithm that creates associative links between dictionary entries, a dictionary entry and publications, as well as between dictionary entry and persona. The advantage of the algorithm is its language independence: vocabulary entries describing the same term, but in different languages, will have the same connections.

There is a one-to-one relationship between the public_cat and zthes_cat  tables. The relation_le column in the zthes_cat table contains the list of terms that is linguistically equivalent to this one. Thus, the database structure allows you to get a list of terms that are linguistically equivalent to the dictionary entry S.

The public_cat table contains the bib_description column, which is intended to implement hard  binding of publications to this dictionary entry. Binding can be done either by a unique publication identifier , or by additional identifiers. All identifiers must be listed in bib_description field. Thus, the database stores the list of publications associated with the dictionary entry S manually.

The public_cat table also contains subject_grnti and subject_udc columns, in which SCSTI and UDC codes can be listed, respectively, associated with the dictionary entry manually. Thus, the dictionary entry S will correspond to the list of publications associated with S by these codes.

The page of the dictionary entry S displays the list of entries associated with S of other entries, as well as references and the list of persons associated with S.

Here, the main thing is to meet the requirements of the interoperability of the created information systems, which leads to the compliance requirement of all interfaces and protocols with the relevant international standards.

The main task of information resource integration is to unite them on a physical or a virtual level into a single information space to provide users with the access to heterogeneous information and the ability to manipulate it. This is done using specialized adaptive administrative and user graphic web interfaces that can adapt to the structure and functionality of information resources.

The development of adaptive user interfaces is the development of client-server applications that would allow to exchange data between programs transparently  and easily that can be anywhere, written in any language, and run under any operating system and on any hardware platform.

DSpace was chosen as the information storage. The system stores information about users, supports authorization and restricts access to this information by groups, network addresses and on the basis of LDAP protocol, which allows you to use an existing user authentication system  and quite easily differentiate public and service resources, while allowing free access to metadata during an IP development. The availability of data providers for OAI-PMH, Z39.50 and SRW/SRU protocols allows the development of a software interface for the interaction of various information systems with a data storage system built on the basis of DSpace.

Integration with Linked Open Data space is one of the universal solutions to this problem. Linked Open Data was created to integrate as much information as possible within each subject area. Thus, publishing data in this space, we get access to all the information that interests us through our data, on the one hand, and we give access to our information on the other hand.

The developed system should be modular, support the possibility of additional functionality development, scalable and compatible with the already used automated systems.

After the comparison, it was concluded that the best would be the following technologies, languages and tools for software application development [15]:

XSLT. A special feature is the ability to separate data from their visual presentation. For the presentation of data, it is enough to refer to the XSLT template for the presentation of a document in an XML file, which, unlike cascading style sheets , provides rich data presentation functionality, including filters, sorts, conditions and loops.

SOAP. This technology is designed to "exchange structured information between distributed applications besides existing web protocols. It allows the cross-interaction of any kind of objects, written under any platform and in any language."

WSDL. The technology for an accurate description of a web service, its address, protocol, port number used, request format and much more.

UDDI. The standard for web service indexing. Business registry definitions, where providers can register their web services, and developers can find them.

Z39.50. The peculiarities of this protocol are "the ability to save system states and the assignment of the corresponding identifier to each state". This allows you to "navigate in time", i.e. you can return to a certain point of search performed earlier at any time.

HTML5. It introduced new elements and attributes to facilitate the interaction of sites with search engines.

Ajax - the technology of asynchronous interaction with the server. Due to this technology, you can send requests to the server and receive answers from it without reloading the page in the background, and create rich interactive web applications.

PHP + Zend Framework, "Model-View-Controller" software architecture. The development and support process consists in application separation into three separate components listed above in such a way that modification of each of them has minimal impact on the others.

There are various protocols by which you can exchange bibliographic information. The most common and supported protocols by almost all existing ABIS are the protocol Z39.50 and OAI-PMH.

The ZooSPACE technology platform, developed using the abovementioned technologies and many others, is in the advanced stage of ICC SB RAS.

The ZooSPACE platform is focused on distributed information systems  development that integrate heterogeneous information resources managed by different DBMS, based on common policies for access development to these resources. ZooSPACE software components operate on various software and hardware server platforms, which are concentrated in distributed system nodes.

In [8], they developed and implemented the adaptive models for information search and presentation in the ZooSPACE-W subsystem for Z39.50 and SRU protocols. Adaptation takes place on WEB server after the selection of a list of information sources based on Explain information.

ZooSPACE-W subsystem is designed to provide administrative and user web interfaces to access information in distributed ZooSPACE system. The following Web server functions are formulated in the requirements to HTTP-Z39.50/SRW/SRU gateway:

provision of administrative and user-friendly graphical web interfaces to access ZooSPACE data;

user authentication via LDAP;

interaction only with current ZooSPACE servers.

For the development of Web interfaces and internal data processing, each ZooSPACE-W subsystem server stores the same set of software that implements the necessary functionality. The availability of multiple servers in ZooSPACE-W subsystem improves server availability and minimizes traffic between different nodes. Because of this, the client can access any of the servers without functionality loss.

When you make a request for Explain record extraction, there is no information about the current number of records in the databases and the ways of access to them. To do this, the corresponding data provider is called in order to obtain this information according to the algorithm shown in Fig. 4 at the time of some request development for the user.

Concluding Remarks
They performed the implementation of conceptual model and the developed linguistic support of the information support system in scientific and educational activities using the IRIS software platform of ICS SB RAS.

The purpose of the system is to satisfy two types of information needs from researchers: the need for information about the sources of necessary scientific information and the need for the most necessary scientific information. The development of a conceptual model is based on DELOS DLRM and OAIS RM models. The main entities used in the model, as well as their classes and subclasses, metadata and relation types, are highlighted and discussed in detail. The model is based on the concept of a document as the main essence of the scientific information space, which includes such classes as competencies, training courses, organizations, data storage facilities, conferences, persons, publications, research projects, grants as well as relationships between them.

As the part of distributed information system, access technologies to distributed information resources  development it is logical to provide access to thesauri within client-server technology using the single standard ANSI/NISO Z39.50.

The process of a digital repository  integration into an information system is based on the model of aggregation and distribution of metadata according to OAI-PMH protocol, which is supported by most systems designed to store information resources. Comparative analysis of software for the development of repositories showed the advantages of Dspace software use, which has the metadata policy based on the Dublin Core scheme and its extensions. DSpace works with OAI-PMH, OpenURL and SWORD protocol for the library sphere.

The task of document categorizing , that is, the assigning of a document to one or several topics, is highly relevant due to the increase of available full-text information amount. The task of publication distribution by rubrics is reduced to the problem of the closest class instance determination into one of the clusters based on some measure of proximity. The paper describes the technology of automatic categorization of documents using the thesaurus.

The research project has perspective and further areas of research for the tasks: It is planned to create the system of distributed repositories to store data and compile controlled dictionaries consisting of preliminary and explicitly defined and carefully selected terms  to describe the concepts related with information resources.
