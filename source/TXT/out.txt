Peculiar;The peculiarities of this protocol are "the ability to save system states and the assignment of the corresponding identifier to each state".;[2:130]
Specific;Specifically, we use the significant variables found within multiple regression analyses to identify probabilistic causal features to help predict funding success.;[1:37]
Unique;Such an analysis can provide unique implications on how investors interpret each side of the entrepreneurial narrative.;[1:35]
Common;Information object is the most common concept in the system, representing an arbitrary unit of information in the information system.;[2:42]
Special;To be able to take this into account, it is necessary to compile special conceptual reference books for each language.;[2:89]
Particular;In addition, research on fraud detection showed that non-fraudulent financial disclosures had higher lexical word diversity, suggesting that particular linguistics can be more credible.;[1:119]
Appropriate;Such expectations are grounded in interpersonal, social, and cultural norms , leading to expectations developing based on appropriate communication styles.;[1:67]

Way;Linguistic features are a direct way for potential investors to get close to the entrepreneur while remaining anonymous.;[1:114]
Technique;This range in ones' ability to persuade based on techniques fitting to their group identity is known as a senders' bandwidth.;[1:74]
Approach;This approach allows for an near-optimal explanation based on a thorough and concise exploration of the features causing the most probable cause of funding success.;[1:40]
Method;However, following an extensive review on communication content in crowdfunding literature , we found three omissions in the current literature: an understanding of the use of vague language in influencing crowdfunding success, a distinct analysis on both the description and the r&c section, and lastly, a method for optimizing the combination of features that will result in the highest probable causes of project success.;[1:18]
Methodology;We imagine that using this bayesian network and genetic algorithm methodology can also optimize effective feedback as an entrepreneur is preparing a page.;[1:346]
Research;Doing so opens an avenue in which to assess the two-sidedness proposition within crowdfunding research directly.;[1:32]
Study;Our study addresses these with a novel method for extracting and analyzing vagueness1 within textual data obtained from kickstarter.;[1:19]

Compute;Next, we computed a given node's conditional probability based upon values assigned to other nodes within the data space: a directed acyclic graph is created.;[1:263]
